# 👾 Hello, World! I'm Hendrik Peters


Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate tinkerer. No matter what it is drones, 3D printers, robot vacuums, ikea sensors or access points. I'll probably alter it in some way or the other.

## 🚀 Quick Highlights

I'm a Cloud/DevOps Engineer. My journey in the world of code has been nothing short of amazing and there is so much more to explore 🛰️.

- 🔭 Currently working on: Portfolio Website, ESP replacement for Govee Lyra Lamp
- 📡 Currently exploring: The vast possibilities of github, GO and microcontrollers

## 💻 Tech Arsenal

In the past I worked with many different languages like C++, C# and Java. Nowadays I'm mainly using the following technologies:

- 🚀 Terraform / HCL
- ⚡ PowerShell
- 🐧 Linux
- 🫐 Azure

I really love to learn new things and if possible do so by implementing them at work or different projects.
